This repository contains supplementary codes to the studies in the paper "Accurate Uncertainty Characterization of Impulsive Thrust Maneuvers in the Restricted Three Body Problem", The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, DOI:10.1007/s40295-023-00394-8.

Please see "UP_main.m" for an example illustrating the data generation process for the study. "compareMoments.m" uses data from different simulations with varying number of Monte Carlo samples, to compare the CUT methodology discussed in the paper with the traditional Monte Carlo scheme.
